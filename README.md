## Introduction
A cellular automaton is a grid of cells, each of which has a state (such as alive/dead). To get the next "generation" of a cellular automaton, the new state of each cell depends on the current states of the cells around it, according to some set of rules.

## About
This is a tool for experimenting with cellular automata, allowing you to vary the dimensions and topology of the board, as well as choose a ruleset. You can also define a custom ruleset, using a very simple formal language created for this webapp.
